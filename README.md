# MailCode

This is a programming language formatted like a letter or email. Each statement must start with a greeting and end with a closing such as:

Dear MailCode,  
(code block)  
Thanks,  
Drew  

The recipient and sender can be whoever you would like, but I find it amusing to address the letter to the language itself.  

The language is currently able to:
* Create and store integer variables
* Print strings and the value of variables
* Loop a block of code a fixed number of times
* Perform basic math opperations on a variable and change its value

To run the code on a command line simply run mailCode.py with a .txt program as a paramater:  
`python mailCode.py code.txt`

3 sample programs have been provided.
